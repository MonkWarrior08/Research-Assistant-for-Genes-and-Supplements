> **Unlock your health insights** - A powerful tool for analyzing scientific literature related to specific genes, SNPs, and supplements to provide personalized health recommendations.


## üìã Overview

The Research Assistant for Genes and Supplements is an AI-powered application that helps individuals understand scientific literature related to specific genes, genetic variants (SNPs), and nutritional supplements. The tool bridges the gap between complex scientific research and personal health insights by:

- Retrieving relevant scientific papers from NCBI databases
- Processing and analyzing paper content with AI
- Providing personalized, accessible interpretations of genetic information
- Translating complex scientific findings into practical health insights
- Offering supplement research based on scientific literature

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç Research Paper Analysis
- **Enhanced gene-specific searches**: Find papers related to particular genes, SNPs, or gene-SNP combinations
- **Genotype analysis**: Understand implications of specific genotypes (e.g., "MTHFR C677T TT")
- **Supplement research**: Analyze scientific literature on nutritional supplements
- **Comprehensive paper details**: View titles, authors, journals, publication dates, and full abstracts
- **Efficient filtering**: Organize research findings by relevance and publication date

### üß† AI-Powered Insights
- **Personalized genetic insights**: Understand what your genes mean for your health and traits
- **Risk assessment**: Learn about potential health conditions associated with specific genetic variants
- **Gene-supplement interactions**: Discover how supplements may interact with your genetic profile
- **Practical applications**: Get actionable lifestyle recommendations based on genetic information
- **Plain language explanations**: Complex scientific concepts explained in accessible terms

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Capabilities
- **Advanced NCBI Integration**: Direct access to PubMed and other scientific databases
- **Real-time analysis**: Generate insights on-demand from the latest research
- **Multi-page interface**: Separate sections for gene and supplement research
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple, intuitive design for both researchers and individuals
- **Comprehensive SNP database**: Access information on thousands of clinically relevant SNPs

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI and NCBI (optional for NCBI, but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gene-research-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NCBI_EMAIL=your_email@example.com  # Required for NCBI E-utilities
   NCBI_API_KEY=your_ncbi_api_key     # Optional but recommended
   ```

### Running the Application

Launch the interactive web interface:
```bash
streamlit run Genes.py
```

## üìñ How to Use

### Gene Research
1. **Enter a gene name, SNP ID, or combination**
   - Simple gene search: "MTHFR", "APOE", "COMT"
   - SNP search: "rs1801133", "rs429358"
